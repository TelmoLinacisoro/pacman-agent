# Eutopia AI Pacman Capture-the-Flag

This project was developed for the Eutopia Pacman contest.

We considered the following factors:

1. **Successor Score**: Potential gains from reaching a specific state (collecting food).
2. **Distance to Key Points**: How far the agent is from important locations (food and opponents).
3. **Enemy Position and State**: Whether an opponent is nearby and whether they are vulnerable or dangerous.

### Agent Design

Each agent evaluates actions based on a heuristic evaluation function:

1. **Offensive Agent**: Focuses on maximizing score by aggressively collecting food items and evading ghosts.
2. **Defensive Agent**: Concentrates on guarding its territory and intercepting enemy Pacman.

The agents anticipate and react to opponentsâ€™ actions. For example, predicting where an opponent will move next based on their current position and potential actions, and adjusting strategies dynamically based on the changing game state and opponent behavior.
